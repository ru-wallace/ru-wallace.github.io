## Starting a Blog

I have decided to start writing a blog. I've had a blog link on my website for a while. Mostly because a personal website feels like it should have one. Now though, I have decided to populate said blog.

I'm aiming to update it at least once a week. It'll mostly contain what I've been doing for my PhD, as well as other side-projects I've been tinkering away on.

Hopefully it will keep me accountable. We'll see how long this lasts.

## My Week

### C++

This week I've been working on some basic C++ stuff for a module I have signed up for in the hopes of some easy credits. In the process of that I've been playing around with Makefiles, github Codespaces, and vcpkg. Generally just overengineering an assignment to read some coordinates, do some processing and print/save the output.
### RAN
I've also been chipping away at calibrating the RAN instrument, a spectrometer controlled by a Raspberry Pi. I have several data sets from running RAN alongside some already calibrated spectrometers, over day/night cycles, and with various optical set-ups.

I had a previous set of scripts for calibration and data processing, but they were very ad hoc, and left messy outputs. I've built a GUI with Tkinter to process the data, and ensured that whatever datasets are output, there is a processing log to record what I've done to the data. I've also been writing a report/procedure for this processing.

Somehow, although I'm reusing large chunks of the old code and have gone through it several times, the output of the calibration seems to be missing large slabs of data from low-light periods, so that's what I'm working on.
### Biology
Another module I've got is to do with introducing biology to physicists. That's on the backburner but I need to figure out when I need to submit the final report for that ASAP.
### Other Business
While this is going on I'm also trying to organise a Christmas Dinner for my Ultimate Frisbee team, which I have left quite late and am rushing to get all their orders in by Wednesday evening, while simultaneously sorting some birthday and early Christmas presents.

Typing this out is a good way to realise how much I actually have on my plate. Hopefully I get round to getting my ADHD med prescription soon.
